# Beyond the tutorial

Here I describe some stuff I do beyond my tutorial. That is from commit `71cc0942156f4f952c716f12113469a31b1fe4fd` and beyond.

## Include the users.

Loopback has already created the 'User' model. Let us make the books belong to an user.

In fact we are not going beyond because, from the beginning, we created a "note" loopback application with no user authentication.

## So what ?

We are going beyond in an other project : [phyCreator]()
