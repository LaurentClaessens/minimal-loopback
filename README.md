# My loopback toy application and tutorial.


The purpose of this repository is twofold :

- provide an example of very minimalistic client/server using loopback and mongo.
- a comprehensive tutorial for that 
- play with that.

For the tutorial, see the [tutorial file](TUTORIAL.md), and see the result on commit `d213ae78fb6abb51e083c0e66d1b8d9eccb4c54a`.

For the stuff made beyond the tutorial, see the [beyond tutorial file](BEYOND.md).
